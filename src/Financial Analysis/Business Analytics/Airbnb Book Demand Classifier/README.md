# 🏨 Airbnb Booking Demand Classifier

Predict whether an Airbnb listing in New York City is likely to be frequently booked based on features like location, pricing, room type, and review activity.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **binary classification task** that uses machine learning to determine if an Airbnb listing is **"frequently booked"**. A listing is labeled as frequently booked if it receives **more than 1 review per month** on average.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

Airbnb hosts and the platform can benefit from understanding what makes a listing successful. This model helps classify listings into:
- **Frequently Booked** (`reviews_per_month > 1`)
- **Infrequently Booked** (`reviews_per_month <= 1`)

---

## 🧠 ML Approach

- **Model Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Target Variable:** `is_frequently_booked` (1 = yes, 0 = no)  
- **Algorithms Used:** Random Forest Classifier (default), but modular for others (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)

## 🧼 Preprocessing

Handled in `preprocess.py`, which:
- Drops entries with missing `reviews_per_month`
- Creates `is_frequently_booked` binary target
- One-hot encodes categorical features
- Fills missing numerical values with median

Used features:
- `neighbourhood_group`
- `room_type`
- `price`
- `minimum_nights`
- `number_of_reviews`
- `availability_365`
- `calculated_host_listings_count`

Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
3. Add your data
Place the airbnb_nyc.csv dataset into the data/ folder.

4. Train the model
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
This will output evaluation metrics and save the model to model/booking_model.pkl.

5. Run prediction
Update the sample_input in predict.py and run:
