Spam Email Classification

##  Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies emails 
as **spam** or **not spam** based on their content. 
The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.

##  Installation and Requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Required libraries include:

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

## Conclusion
The classification model achieved a high performance with:

Accuracy: ~93%

Precision: ~92%

Recall: ~90%

F1-Score: ~91%

These results indicate that the model is effective at distinguishing between spam and 
non-spam emails, making it a useful tool for basic email filtering tasks.
